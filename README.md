# molpath

VR molecular modelling pathfinding project

goals:

visualisation / teaching / multiscale molecular modelling 'sketch' tool


features:

interactive polypeptide backbone built from simple primitives

Unity physics joints used to represent bonded / non-bonded interactions (e.g. dihedrals / hydrogen bonds)

not intended to be a simulation
